# Welcome, traveller!
This is a HCF Core for PM5. Yeah, it may not be the best, but here we are. From here on, I don't need it anymore as I'm making new HCF Core on nukkit. 

## Requirements
You should have PM5(nethergames fork). Don't forget about webhooks.

Yeah, this core may not be the best to be ran, but at least it's something. Everyone is allowed to take any piece of software here and use for their software(according to MIT license). Have fun!
